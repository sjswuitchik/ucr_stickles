This repository contains the code and associated data access for a collaboration between University of California Riverside, University of Calgary,  Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre, and Mount Royal University on the genetic basis of kinematics and morphometrics of threespine stickleback. 

Associated Investigators: 

Sara Smith (Assisant Professor, Mount Royal University) 

Seth Shirazi (Ph.D. candidate, University of California Riverside)

Tim Higham (Professor, University of California Riverside)

Sean Rogers (Professor, University of Calgary; Director, Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre) 

Code and analyses are tenatively finalized.
